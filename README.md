### Auto Loan Default Prediction
**Ranjeev Kumar**

#### Executive summary
This project involves data processing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) for a dataset related to loan defaults. The analysis includes visualizations, feature importance, and model evaluation using ROC-AUC curves.

#### Rationale
Understanding the factors that contribute to loan defaults is crucial for financial institutions to mitigate risks and make informed lending decisions. This analysis aims to identify key features that influence loan defaults and evaluate the performance of predictive models.

#### Research Question
What are the key factors that influence loan defaults, and how accurately can we predict loan defaults using machine learning models?

#### Data Sources
The dataset used in this analysis includes various features related to loan applications and borrower information. The data is sourced from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/avikpaul4u/vehicle-loan-default-prediction/data

#### Methodology
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Importance Analysis using Random Forest
4. Model Evaluation using ROC-AUC Curves for Random Forest and Gradient Boosting

#### Results
The analysis identified the top features influencing loan defaults and evaluated the performance of Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models. The ROC-AUC curves indicate the models' ability to distinguish between default and non-default cases.

#### Next steps
1. Further tuning of model hyperparameters to improve performance.
2. Exploration of additional machine learning models.
3. Incorporation of more features or external data sources to enhance predictive power.

#### Outline of project
